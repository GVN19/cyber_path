# Day 2 – What is Networking?

## Key Concepts:
- A network is a group of devices (computers, servers, phones) that share resources and information.
- Basic network components: switches, routers, firewalls, access points.
- A network allows communication via protocols (rules), such as TCP/IP.
- Data is sent in packets through different layers (explained later in OSI Model).

## Important Takeaways:
- IP addresses identify devices on a network.
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses (e.g., google.com → 142.250.190.78).
- Port numbers help identify specific services on a device (e.g., port 80 = HTTP).
